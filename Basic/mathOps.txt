REM This is the program that JDoodle autofills for Free Basic
REM I am using it to play around with different math functions
Dim x as Integer = 10
DIM y as Integer = 25
DIM z as Integer
z = x + y

print "x = ";x
print "y = ";y
print "Sum of x + y = "; z

Dim a as Integer = 2
Dim b as Integer = 5
Dim c as Integer
c = a * b

print "a = ";a
print "b = ";b
print "a * b  = "; c
